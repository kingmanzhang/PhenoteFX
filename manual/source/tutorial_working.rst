Updating the evidence code for an existing entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Occasionally, we would like to update an existing annotation. For instance, we would like to add a PubMed citation
for an entry that was created by text mining. In this case, we will update the evidence code from ``IEA`` (inferred
from electronic annotation) to ``PCS`` (published clinical study). To do this, right click on the table cell with
the evidence code and choose the updated evidence code. You will see a popup menu with the four available evidence
codes. Click the desired code to update the code in the table.
