PhenoteFX: A tool for annotating the Human Phenotype Ontology
=============================================================

PhenoteFX is a Java 8 App based on the JavaFX framework that is designed to carry on the tradition of the original
Phenote. Currently, PhenoteFX is specialized for working with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) only.


PhenoteFX is designed to help curators revise or create phenotype annotation records for Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
rare disease data. Support will be added for common disease annotations in the future.
